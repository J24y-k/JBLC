            <h3>He Deserves Celebration</h3> <br>
            <p>This is a special day dedicated to gathering in worship and praise to glorify the Lord. As it is written in Psalms 34:4, "Glorify the Lord with me; let us exalt his name together." It is a time to celebrate God for all He has done and for what He is yet to do. We will also be blessed by various artists sharing their gifts with us.</p>

            <p>Inspired by Isaiah 40:31 - "But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint." These are days of intense prayer, seeking God’s presence, receiving divine impaction , and growing spiritually.</p>
